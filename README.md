# Meteorites

This is a game that was lost for over a decade, then suddenly reappeared - how nice!
It was on the nation wide TV2 channel in Norway in the late 90's, and over night made some careers I would say.
It also attracted the super investor Øysten Stray Spetalen, so all this was a huge door opener for us back then.

The code is from a time where OpenGL drivers where too buggy for production use unless you had a Silicon Graphics or something,
so it's all tied up in the terrible Glide 3D API of Voodoo Graphics. The first hardware accelerated 3D cards I laid my hands on.

The graphics is not included, as it's yet to reappear to see the light of day - how sad..

But hey, it's old crap so use it as you like.
Not that anyone in their right mind would use this code. :-)
